## ✨ What it does

No more clicking through files blindly. Image Thumbnail Explorer adds a dedicated **Image Thumbnails** panel to your Explorer sidebar — every image file in your workspace is shown with a live thumbnail preview, right next to its filename.

Perfect for:

- 🎨 **Designers** managing asset libraries
- 📱 **App developers** working with icon sets
- 🗂️ **Anyone** tired of opening images one by one just to find the right one

## 📸 Preview

```
📁 Image Thumbnails
├── 🖼 about.png
├── 🖼 add_image.png
├── 🖼 background.png
├── 📁 icons/
│   ├── 🖼 bolt.svg
│   ├── 🖼 calendar.svg
│   └── 🖼 add.png
└── 🖼 splash.jpg
```

Each file shows its actual image content as a small icon — not a generic file icon.

## 🔄 Auto-refresh

The panel automatically updates when you:

- Add new image files to your workspace

- Rename or move files

No manual refresh needed.

---

## 🛠️ Extension Settings

This extension works out of the box with no required configuration. Future versions will add settings for:

- Filtering by file type
- Custom thumbnail size
- Exclude folders (e.g. `node_modules`)

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Collapse folders** that don't have images — the panel only shows folders containing at least one image, keeping things clean
- **Click to open** — clicking any thumbnail opens the full image in the VS Code image viewer
- **Use the refresh button** in the panel title bar if thumbnails ever get out of sync

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Very large workspaces with thousands of images may take a moment to load on first open
